# QuestBoard
QuestBoard is a lightweight game community hub where players can track games, create “quests” (goals/challenges), and share session notes. Think of it as a personal backlog and progress tracker with simple social features. The app focuses on clean MVC structure, EF Core modeling, diagnostics, and deployment-friendly practices.
