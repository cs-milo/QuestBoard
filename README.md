üéÆ QuestBoard

A Player‚Äôs Journal for Games, Goals, and Progress

Project Summary

QuestBoard is a web app built with ASP.NET Core MVC that lets players track their gaming goals, progress, and play sessions in one place.
It‚Äôs designed as both a lightweight productivity tool for gamers and a demonstration of clean architecture, data modeling, dependency injection, CRUD functionality, logging, diagnostics, and cloud deployment.

Over the course of several weeks, the app evolves from a basic EF Core data model into a full-featured MVC application with structured logging, health checks, and a final deployment to Azure App Service. The project showcases modern web development practices using C#, Razor Views, and Entity Framework Core.
