# QuestBoard
QuestBoard is a lightweight game community hub where players can track games, create “quests” (goals/challenges), and share session notes. Think of it as a personal backlog and progress tracker with simple social features. The app focuses on clean MVC structure, EF Core modeling, diagnostics, and deployment-friendly practices.

| **10**   | **Modeling**                       | Create `Player`, `Game`, `Quest`, and `PlaySession` entities with relationships | Persist players, games, and play sessions                             | ✅ EF Core migration creates tables <br>✅ Relationships (Player→Quests, Player→PlaySessions, Game→Quests, Game→PlaySessions)<br>✅ Seed sample data   | Implemented code + migration files <br>Short schema note (keys, required fields) <br>Screenshots of tables and seed data      | Run migration; verify tables and relationships in SQL Server or LocalDB; confirm sample data loads correctly                  |
| **11**   | **Separation of Concerns / DI**    | Add `IProgressService` to calculate player progress (quest completion %)        | Move calculation logic out of controllers into a service              | ✅ Interface + implementation <br>✅ Registered in DI container <br>✅ Returns accurate progress metrics                                               | Code snippet of DI setup; ~200-word write-up on service layer; screenshot of controller calling the service and sample output | Unit tests for `ProgressService` covering edge cases (no quests, partial completions, time range calculations)                |
| **12**   | **CRUD**                           | Add Create/Edit/Delete forms for `Quest`                                        | Players can define and manage their in-game goals                     | ✅ Create/Edit forms render correctly <br>✅ Validation messages show for required fields <br>✅ Saves to DB and redirects (Post-Redirect-Get pattern) | Implemented forms and controller methods; screenshots of validation and final quest list; short PRG explanation               | Integration test: POST valid quest → 302 redirect → quest appears in list <br>POST invalid → same view with validation errors |
| **13**   | **Diagnostics**                    | Add `/healthz` endpoint                                                         | Provide a liveness check to verify app health                         | ✅ `/healthz` returns 200 OK <br>✅ Startup log shows current environment (Development / Production)                                                  | Curl or browser screenshot of `/healthz` = OK; startup log snippet in README                                                  | Manual curl test; stop DB to observe behavior; confirm “OK” for basic liveness                                                |
| **14**   | **Logging**                        | Add structured logs for quest creation and session activity                     | Trace user actions and app behavior for diagnostics                   | ✅ `ILogger` logs Information for Create/Edit/Delete <br>✅ Log includes `QuestId`, `PlayerId`, `GameId` and timestamp                                | Log output screenshot + code snippet showing logger usage; explanation of log levels (Information, Warning, Error)            | Manual test: perform Create/Edit/Delete actions and verify log entries in Output window or console                            |
| **15**   | **Stored Procedures**              | Call stored procedure “Top 5 Games by Hours Played”                             | Generate a server-side leaderboard query using SQL SP for performance | ✅ Stored procedure executes successfully <br>✅ Mapped to a ViewModel <br>✅ Results render on a Leaderboard page                                     | Screenshot of SP result and EF Core execution snippet; short write-up comparing SP vs LINQ performance                        | Compare SP output to LINQ query results on same dataset for validation                                                        |
| **16**   | **Deployment (Azure App Service)** | Deploy QuestBoard to Azure App Service with CI/CD                               | Make the app publicly accessible and maintainable                     | ✅ Azure App Service created <br>✅ App builds and runs in cloud <br>✅ `/healthz` reachable online <br>✅ At least one functional page works           | Screenshot of live URL and `/healthz` response; deployment notes in README; GitHub Actions config snippet                     | Visit public URL; confirm home page and `/healthz` load successfully; verify logs from production App Service                 |
